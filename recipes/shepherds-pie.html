    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is your classic shepherds pie, full of flavour and oh so simple to make.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 medium carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>500g lamb mince</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato puree</li>
        <li>large splash Worchestershire sauce</li>
        <li>500ml beef stock</li>
        <li>900g potatoes,  cut into chunkks</li>
        <li>85g butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp sunflower oil in a medium saucepan, then soften 1 chopped onion and 2-3 chopped carrots for a few mins.</li>
        <li>When soft, turn up the heat, crumble in 500g lamb mince and brown, tipping off any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp tomato pur√©e and a large splash of Worcestershire sauce, then fry for a few mins.</li>
        <li>Pour over 500ml beef stock, bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for 40 mins, uncovering halfway.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4, then make the mash. Boil the 900g potato, cut into chunks, in salted water for 10-15 mins until tender. Drain, then mash with 85g butter and 3 tbsp milk.</li>
        <li>Put the mince into an ovenproof dish, top with the mash and ruffle with a fork. The pie can now be chilled and frozen for up to a month.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 mins until the top is starting to colour and the mince is bubbling through at the edges. (To bake from frozen, cook at 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 for 1 hr-1 hr 20 mins until piping hot in the centre. Flash under the grill to brown, if you like.)</li>
        <li>Leave to stand for 5 mins before serving.</li>
    </ol>
