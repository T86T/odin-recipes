The Odin Project, Project: Recipes


In this project I will be creating a recipe website, which will have an index page that will contain links to other pages containing recipes.

It will be pretty basic but will show my understanding of  the following:

*File  order.
*Creating links.
*Adding images.
*Using  ordered and unordered lists.
*using  GitHub.

Update:

The Odin Project has taught me the basics of CSS, and asked me to use it on my previosly created recipe website which i have now done, here are some of the things I implemented.

*Used  external CSS
*Linked the .css file to html file
*Changed text fonts, color and alignment.
*Changed links from list to buttons, moved and designed them.
*modifified image size and alignment  (threw up so issues, more about  that below)
*Changed background color

Some issues did occur, I couldnt get images to center  (hadn't learnt that at this yet with The Odin Project) after a bit  of research I used disply: block; margin: auto; command to achieve this. Also while images fit pc web browser ok, on viewing via a mobile phone the images were  to big so I used command width: 50%; height: auto; to fix this.
